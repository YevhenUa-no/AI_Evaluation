# business and finance data visualization ( data profiling ) ; # automated or assisted map , graph , diagram , or image construction from text or data ; event , process , and knowledge editing and visualization tools ; # and knowledge navigation over databases , texts , and search results . the specific issues addressed by the workshop include but are not limited to : 1 . definition of content : different disciplines and applications have distinct perspectives on what content is , e . g . , of text , video , graphics , collections of interactions or correspondences . 2 . knowledge representation : i . e . , what it is , how to represent it , reason about it , and present it . 3 . taxonomies of content representations , tasks , and visualization artifacts . 4 . representations for content and how these relate to and / or facilitate visualization tasks . 5 . selection and organization of content : deciding what to present and how to organize the presentation of selected content and why ( i . e . , effect ) . 6 . deciding how to coordinate the presentation of content through several media : 7 . the relationship of cognitive task to visualization content and style ( e . g . , visualization structure , properties , form , coherency , interpretability , and accuracy of displays ) . 8 . deciding how to accept and integrate input from several media . 9 . medium - specific encoding of content . 10 . presentation and interaction techniques of generated results . 11 . tailoring visualizations to specific user and usergroup characteristics , knowledge , and interests . 12 . content visualization evaluation metrics and methods . we encourage submissions of demonstrations and / or videos of working visualizations pertaining to the above topics . the organizers will produce a workshop report and , providing there is sufficient interest and adequate results reported , will consider a special edited journal issue and / or state of the art collection . authors are encouraged to submit their workshop papers simultaneously for public discussion to the area intelligence user interfaces of the electronic transactions on artificial intelligence ( etai ) . the etai is a new kind of electronic journal using open and posteriori reviewing . formally , the rules work as follows . in the etai , you first have the article discussed for three months , then you have a chance to revise it based on the feedback , and then you decide whether to submit it for refereeing in the etai or in some other journal . for more information , see : http : / / www . ida . liu . se / ext / etai / . sponsors : sigmedia ( acl 's special interest group on multimedia language processing ) acl / coling program committee : elisabeth andre , dfki saarbruecken branimir boguraev , ibm watson research steve feiner , columbia university michael johnston , oregon graduate institute mark maybury , mitre corporation james pustejovsky , brandeis university steve roth , carnegie mellon university wolfgang wahlster , dfki saarbruecken kent wittenburg , gte laboratories program chairs : james pustejovsky , brandeis university mark t . maybury , mitre requirements for submission : papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use us or a4 letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the acl style file for latex . ms - word users should use the acl style file for ms - word . submissions can be made either as hardcopies or electronically in ascii , postscript , html , or ms - word format . they should be sent to : james pustejovsky cvir ' 98 computer science department 258 volen brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 email : jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu more detailed information on the workshop can be found at : http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ jamesp / cvir / timetable * deadline for electronic submissions : march 11 , 1998 * deadline for hardcopy submissions : march 13 ( arrival date ) * notification of acceptance : may 1 , 1998 * final manuscripts due : june 12 , 1998 organizer information : mark t . maybury , director advanced information systems center the mitre corporation ( ms k308 ) 202 burlington road bedford , ma 01730 tel : 1-78 - 271-7230 fax : 1-781 - 271-2780 maybury @ mitre . org james pustejovsky , associate professor computer science department and volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu james pustejovsky associate professor computer science department and volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 usa voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ jamesp http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ rllc",Safe Email,0

Date: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its 
wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As 
several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their 
most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used 
to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an 
attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and 
Google bombing[3]. Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked 
site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 
linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell""
[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] 
no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were 
previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on 
whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 
caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on 
medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far 
as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work 
putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive 
with complaints and speculation: - New update, pagerank death?[8] 
- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] 
- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] (Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no 
longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely 
false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]
, where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly 
degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam 
sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so 
good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 
frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're 
tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It 
didn't take long. - Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a 
hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems 
unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and 
Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). 
- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC 
newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet 
betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. 
- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent 
site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 
(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I 
didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't 
that helpful. Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com
[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their 
results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the 
beginning of the end of Google's reign?[1]  http://www.google.com/search?q=mark

Float:Â Â  5 MillionInsider & Institutional Holdings:92% SharesÂ Â Â "" CXIN MEDIA CORPORATION, THE BLOOMBERG OF CHINA."" - Finance and Investment Magazine, December 2001Â THE COMPANY:CXIN Media Corporation is an integrated media company focusing on the dissemination and aggregation of information. Currently, CXINs core business is in the publishing and aggregation of Financial, Economic, and Business Information on the Peoples Republic of China. The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, and present information that is highly in demand by the market.Apart from the core print and electronic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, such as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and training in the field of wealth management and personal finance.These areas are closely linked to the core competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands that they have built to further drive the growth potential.CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Republic of China. In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direct management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Development Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.HIGHLIGHTS:May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Exclusive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish, Internationally.February 2002, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market research provider.March 2002, CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique financial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of China.Â May 7, 2002, CXIN announces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket company and the leading provider of emerging market securities.May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President, Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China Morning Post and Asia Magazine.June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling subscriptions.June 24, 2002, CXIN announces the acquisition ofÂ  Smart Investor Magazine and related business. This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consolidated revenues.Â July 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis, one of the worlds largest aggregators.INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, which analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 years to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this industry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchandise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well positioned to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing Chinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted by the Chinese government provide the company with an ""unfair advantage"" over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent license agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will enable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Million within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancing, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue and profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sector CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and above this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.Disclaimer: The Wall Street Weekly provides information on selected companies that it believes has investment potential.

COCKLES OF ONE'S HEART  You may recall that I was a bit suspicious
of the story I told in last week's issue. James Woodfield pointed
out that there is another possible explanation. In medieval Latin,
the ventricles of the heart were at times called ""cochleae cordis"",
where the second word is derived from ""cor"", heart. Those unversed
in Latin could have misinterpreted ""cochleae"" as ""cockles"". Oddly,
""cochlea"" in Latin means ""snail"" (from the shape of the ventricles
- it's also the name of the spiral cavity of the inner ear), so if
this story is right we should really be speaking of warming the
snails of one's heart.SERRANCIFIED  Many of you supplied your own memories of this odd
expression that I tried to make sense of last week. Taken together,
they show that the expression is best known in Canada and that it
was originally something like ""My sufficiency has been suffonsified
and anything additional would be superfluous"". That form of the
word is the one that is most common in online searches, where the
Canadian focus is also obvious. Cheryl Caesar noted that it appears
in a passage in Margaret Atwood's novel, ""Cat's Eye"": she has two
teenage girls living in Toronto in the 1940s who say, ""Are you
sufficiently sophonisified?"". A Vancouver restaurant reviewer has
the pen name ""Sufficiently Suffonsified"". Oddly, there's also a
1999 record by the Austrian band Cunning Dorx entitled ""Paradigms
Suffonsified"". G H Gordon Paterson suggested that the word might be
a punning blend of ""sufficient"" and ""fancified"". There are some
tantalising suggestions that it may actually be Scots, and not New
World at all.ABSQUATULATE  I have been gently remonstrated with for describing
""sockdologer"" as one of the products of early American linguistic
inventiveness that hasn't survived to the present day. Many people
gave me examples of current or recent use. I stand corrected.
2. Turns of Phrase: Thinspiration
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of the key words associated with a deeply disquieting
online trend. In the past couple of years or so a number of Web
sites and chatrooms have appeared which actively promote anorexia
nervosa (known on the sites as ""ana"") and other eating disorders as
lifestyle choices. Since 90% of anorexics are young women, these
""pro-ana"" sites are usually run by and attract that group (one term
sometimes used for them is ""weborexics""). Sites offer suggestions
on how to become and remain thin, often through tips on avoiding
eating, and how to disguise the condition from family and friends.
Other themes sometimes featured on such sites are self-mutilation
(""cutting"") and bulimia (""mia""). Thin women, such as supermodels
and Calista Flockhart, are presented as ""thinspirations"", examples
to emulate. Sites have had names such as Starving for Perfection,
Wasting Away on the Web and Dying To Be Thin. Medical professionals
in the US and UK are deeply concerned about them, because they
accentuate the low self-regard of young women, who are particularly
prone to eating disorders, put their lives at risk, and discourage
them from facing their illness and seeking treatment for it.The Internet is home to a number of pro-eating disorder Web sites -
- places where sufferers can discuss tips, trade low-calorie
recipes and exchange poems and art that may be used as ""triggers""
or so-called ""thinspiration.""
                                         [""Calgary Sun"", Feb. 2002]A new trend among young adults has been sweeping the nation: pro-
anorexia Web sites. Also known as pro-ana, these sites glorify
anorexia nervosa and offer ""thinspiration"" on maintaining a
starvation lifestyle.
                                     [""University Wire"", Apr. 2002]
3. Weird Words: Usufructuary  /ju:zjU'frVktju:@rI/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A person who has the use or enjoyment of something, especially
property.We are short of words that contain four u's. Among the few that are
even relatively common (leaving aside the Hawaiian ""muu-muu"") are
""tumultuously"" and ""unscrupulous"", although some rare words like
""pustulocrustaceous"" and ""pseudotuberculous"" are also recorded.The term comes from Roman law. ""Usufruct"" is the right of temporary
possession or enjoyment of something that belongs to somebody else,
so far as that can be done without causing damage or changing its
substance. For example, a slave in classical Rome could not own
anything. Things he acquired as the result of his labour he merely
held ""usus (et) fructus"", under ""use (and) enjoyment"" - it was his
master who actually owned them.The term remains in use in modern US legal practice and elsewhere.
These days a ""usufructuary"" can be a trustee who enjoys the income
from property he holds in trust for somebody else. Many Native
American groups hold land on a ""usufruct"" basis, with rights to
enjoy the renewable natural resources of the land for hunting and
fishing.
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How does the term ""three sheets to the wind"" denote drunkenness?
[Benjamin Weatherston]A. It's a sailor's expression.We ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail, but in
traditional sailing-ship days, a ""sheet"" was actually a rope,
particularly one attached to the bottom corner of a sail (it comes
from an Old English term for the corner of a sail). The sheets were
vital, since they trimmed the sail to the wind. If they ran loose,
the sail would flutter about in the wind and the ship would wallow
off its course out of control.Extend this idea to sailors on shore leave, staggering back to the
ship after a good night on the town, well tanked up. The irregular
and uncertain locomotion of the jolly seafarers must have reminded
onlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose.
Perhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image
across, so the saying became ""three sheets to the wind"".Our first written example comes from that recorder of low life,
Pierce Egan, in his ""Real life in London"" of 1821. But it must
surely be much older.                        -----------Q. My East End mother-in-law used to say she was ""well and truly
mogadored"" when she was puzzled by something. Any idea of
derivation and meaning? [Bryan]A. Now that's a bit of British slang I haven't heard in years,
though it is still around (Nanny Ogg uses it in one of Terry
Pratchett's Discworld fantasy stories, I am told). As you say, it
means that somebody is puzzled, confused, or ""all at sea"". It's
also sometimes spelled ""moggadored"", though it doesn't turn up in
print much in either spelling. (No relation to the British word
""moggy"" for a cat, by the way, which seems to be a pet form of
""Margaret"".)The writers of slang dictionaries are decidedly mogadored about its
origin. It looks very much like rhyming slang for ""floored"", which
is likewise slang, meaning dumbfounded or confused. But the dispute
arises over what the root is. Some say it is Irish, from ""magagh"",
to mock, jeer or laugh at, via an unrecorded intermediate form
""mogadÃ³i"".Others suggest that, like some other East End slang terms, it
derives from the Gypsy language Romany (Cockney slang is like
London itself, a melting pot, in which words from many sources are
amalgamated, including Yiddish and old-time forces slang derived
from languages around the world). In this case the source may be
""mokardi"" or ""mokodo"", something tainted (these Romany words also
provide the root for yet another slang phrase, ""to put the mockers
on something"", to jinx it).Sorry not to be able to be more definite!                        -----------Q. I was having an interesting discussion with an American
professor of business studies who also consults to industry. She
was recalling an unbudgeted initiative within a major software
corporate, which the UK managing director described as a ""skunk
project"". I have seen this epithet before, usually in the phrase
""skunk works"", meaning a semi-official project team that is tacitly
licensed to bend the rules and think outside the box. I wonder what
the derivation is? I don't think it can refer to the smelly wild
animal, but neither I think can it refer to the street term for a
strong variant of marijuana. Can you shed any light? [Martin
Hayman]A. We must start in Dogpatch, the fictional place in the backwoods
of upper New York State made famous between 1934 and 1977 as the
home of professional mattress tester Li'l Abner, in the comic strip
written and drawn by Al Capp. The original was actually ""Skonk
Works"", the place where Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe brewed
their highly illicit bootleg Kickapoo Joy Juice from ingredients
such as old shoes and dead skunks. (""Skonk"" is a dialect variant of
""skunk"".)We must now move to the very real Burbank, California. In 1943, a
small group of aeronautical engineers working for the then Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation (headed by Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson) were
given the rush job of creating an entirely new plane from scratch,
the P-80 ""Shooting Star"" jet fighter. This they did in 143 days, 37
days ahead of schedule. Their secret project was housed in a
temporary structure roofed over with an old circus tent, which had
been thrown up next to a smelly plastics factory. The story goes
that one of the engineers answered the phone on a hot summer day
with the phrase ""Skonk Works here"" and the name stuck. It is also
said that Al Capp objected to their use of his term and it was
changed to Skunk Works.One division of the company, formally the Lockheed Martin Advanced
Development Program, is still known as the Skunk Works. The term
has been trademarked by Lockheed Martin, who have been aggressive
in protecting it.As a generic term, it dates from the 1960s. One definition is very
much that of the original and the one you describe: a small group
of experts who drop out of the mainstream of a company's operations
in order to develop some experimental technology or new application
in secrecy or at speed, unhampered by bureaucracy or the strict
application of regulations (Kelly Johnson formulated 14 visionary
rules for running such an operation, which are still regarded as
valid even now). It is also sometimes used for a similar group that
operates semi-illicitly, without top-level official knowledge or
support, though usually with the tacit approval of immediate
management.

    Damn, this thing is slick.  Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say ""Cool; I can understand this"" and leave their shackles behind.  :)    I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.    This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.    At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc.  But for the wide release, this one's IT.  If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased.

14137,"proposal for a morphological database of classical greek i am writing to seek input on a proposal that we tentatively plan to submit to the neh at the end of the summer . the idea is fairly simple : we want to use the morphological parser that we have been developing for the past eight years or so to generate morphological analyses of every unique string in the thesaurus linguae graecae ( tlg ) , the database of greek texts available on cd rom from uc irvine . the tlg is large - - 42 million words at present and a new version is due out later this year with 57 million words . greek is a highly inflected language - - not as bad as georgian and some others , but a verb can , with prefixes , have millions of different forms . the tlg corpus extends over a thousand years and includes virtually all literary greek , and thus would support diachronic as well as synchronic linguistic analysis . i would like to know if there is anything we could do that would make this work on greek useful for the linguistics community in general ? classicists need this database , but it would be very exciting if it could stimulate additional work . the working summary of the project follows . the proposal outline is fairly succinct ( c . 7 pages ) but it is full of greek and does not lend itself readily to transliteration . if you would like to see a copy , please send me your us mail address and we will send one to you . casual reactions to just this summary are , however , more than welcome . note : reactions need not be positive . if this does not seem a worthwhile thing to pursue , i would love to know why . thanks ! gregory crane department of classics boylston 319 harvard university cambridge ma 02138 crane @ ikaros . harvard . edu a linguistic database of classical greek this project will extend an existing parser for classical greek , expanding its database of stems to cover the majority of all words attested in the literary record , and will use this database to create a morphologically parsed database of more than 1 , 000 , 000 unique strings available in the tlg : in the end , we will publish the database of analyzed strings , the databases of stems and endings which drive the parser and the parser itself . the resulting databases are an essential piece of scholarly infrastructure that will ( 1 ) revolutionize current searching techniques for the tlg and other greek databases , ( 2 ) make it possible to apply more sophisticated retrieval / text analysis to greek texts , and ( 3 ) provide a basic but crucial lookup tool that will aid non-specialists in other fields ( e . g . , philosophy , political science , religion ) who seek to work directly with the greek database . note : this document is a sketch for a possible proposal to be submitted to the neh at the end of august 1992 . it is , in effect , a proposal for a proposal and is thus open to revision on any and all points .",Safe Email,0

absolutely necessary.  This will help because some packages are named
differently between distributions (eg. SDL <-> libSDL), and the
dependencies are automatically handled by RPM by depending on shared
library names.This doesn't apply to BuildRequires: though.Use macros for directory names where available, eg %{_libdir},
%{_bindir}, %{_datadir} etc.I'd like to suggest using as many RPM macros for command names as
possible too, but unfortunately I don't know of a definitive reference
about them...I have a small RedHat 7.3 RPM/apt repository at
, and I've received reports from people
running Mandrake 8.x and SuSE that the RPMs work with them out of the
box.--

11889,"proposed decision the gd article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good readers digest version of the order . susan and i spoke with jeff dasovich and mark baldwin yesterday , and the consensus of those conversations was that transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementation / documentation . jeff offered that he might send a letter to governor gray ' s office expressing both dismay and indignation that the cpuc didn ' t complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to california ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved . he may ask the other comprehensive settlement parties to join in signing the letter . susan , mark and i spoke about this idea later , and we ' ve got some reservations about tw ' s role in admonishing the cpuc . we should probably wait to see this letter first before committing to anything . bilas draft cautious toward socal competition mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state , california public utilities commissioner richard bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on southern california gas  , ( socal ) system . in his draft decision , bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundling of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case , the less far - reaching interim settlement ( is ) , submitted in december 1999 . socal , san diego gas and electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the is , reaching a comprehensive agreement in april this year . but since then , gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state , prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name . the draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements . recent events  & lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation , the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm , tradable intrastate transmission rights , should be delayed ,  8 according to the draft order .  & this unbundling is the basis of the [ comprehensive settlement ] and we cannot approve it . we do not , however , wish to commit to paralysis until 2006 , as the [ post - interim settlement ] would have us do . accordingly , we believe californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption , with modifications , of the is .  8 the biggest change to the is in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by socal at wheeler ridge , calif . , with rolled - in rates if certain criteria are met . el paso energy had objected to the provision in the is that would have allowed socal to automatically expand capacity at wheeler ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of curtailments oc - curred . el paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at wheeler when only certain customers would benefit . the draft says socal can file a separate application for the wheeler ridge expansion , but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing process . the draft decision would also :   end socal  , s current    establish hector road as a formal receipt point for nominations ;   institute an operational flow order ( ofo ) procedure . provides a forum for more changes in ofo procedures if excessive ofos are made ;   set up    make changes to balancing rules , while retaining the current 10 % monthly imbalance tolerance ;   make socal  , s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balancing rules and penalties as all other shippers ;   allow some limited imbalances trading , as well as the right to assign and reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market , with a socal electronic bulletin board set up for it ;   unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost exceeding that required for core minimum reliability ; and   provide for rate recovery of up to $ 3 . 5 million in implementation costs . in addition , the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from rates , eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges , eliminate the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs . the threshold for participating in core aggregation is reduced , and billing options are offered to core aggregators . bilas  , draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition , taking into account any changes in market conditions . bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft .  we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by marketers if more competition is allowed ,  8 bilas wrote in the draft decision .  & with half the state already committed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry , it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re - structuring to enhance competition are speculative , particularly at this time . with one leg in the water , the current has switched direction and it will be difficult , if not foolhardy , to reach our goals by forging ahead .  & we choose to take a cautious approach again ,  8 the draft continues .  & rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in southern california now , we approve , with modifications , the settle - ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market . additionally , we unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the legislature to pass consumer protection legisla - tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core aggregation programs .  8 the cpuc would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and other restruc - turing in the future  & but believe that at this point in time the certain benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers .  8 all drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be discussed . the draft decision is currently on the agenda for the cpuc  , s dec . 21 meeting .",Safe Email,0

                  URGENT AND NOBLE PROPOSALATTN: DIRECTOR.
DEAR ,I wish to extend my greeting to you and your entire
family. I got your contact from the ivoirian chamber
of commerce, I prayed over it and selected your name
among other names because of its esteeming
nature.Morever,after my strong prayers and fasting,
God reveals to me that you are straight forward,
Honest and GodÂ’s person.
This is the reason I never waste time to propose you
this business for our mutual benefits. Infact, You
will never regret it provided you give me your
possible best cooperate hand, Believe me.I am MARTIN FRANCIS, A cote dÂ’ivoire national and the
only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here, he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)
this is the fund I want to transferred to your account
as the beneficiary contractor due for payment,providedyou cooperate.Therefore I am seeking your full and
urgent  assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars, us$16,500.000 US dollars to your
designated account for a very good business investment
in your country as due to the instruction my father
gave to me before he late. What I require from you are
as follows.1.Your private telephone and fax number for easy and
strict communication
2.Your bank particular for smooth and successful
remittance of this monies to your nominated account
3.You have to make necessary arrangement for me to
meet with you immediately the monies is been
transferred in your account and confirmed by you.
4.You have to secure a college for me in your country
to further my education. 
5.You will have to be my guardian and part of the
joint venture investment when I get to your country.Furthermore, my late father had instructed me to offer
20 % of the total sum to the person who is to assist
me out for the transferring of this fund.Moreover, I wish to assure you that this transaction
would be concluded within the next(3)days you signify
interest to assist me out.I suggest that this
transaction should be handled in strict confidence
because I have work out fine every modalities
concerning the transfer of this fund. 
Please and please, kindly hasten up the arrangement as
quickly as possible because my late father instructed
me not to invest this monies in this country CÃ´te-
dÂ’Ivoire. That I should invest abroad of my choice for
the benefit of myself and for security reasons.Thank very much in anticipation of your
acknowledgement of this business proposal and do not
hesitate to contact me immediately you receive this
message with this my direct telephone number mentioned
above, tel : + 225 05775748 for us to proceed
immediately. Please and please, donÂ’t fail.waiting for your urgent response nowthanks very much again and God bless.best regardsMARTIN FRANCIS.

4351,"think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with Bureaucracy. Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) Canada. It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own ""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars. They finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?-Ian. On Tuesday, August 20, 2002, at 12:09 PM, John Hall wrote:The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else -- by Hernando De Soto Is something I'm reading now.My impression is that France is not anywhere near the ""Permit Raj"" nightmare that India is (and became). Nor has its market been closed like India's has.But De Soto's work is perhaps just as important or more so. He hasn't dealt specifically with India, but I recall examples from Peru, Philippines, and Egypt. In Lima, his team took over a year (I think it was 2) working 8 hr days to legally register a 1 person company. In the Philippines, getting legal title can take 20 years. In Egypt, about 80% of the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially illegal.India hasn't been helped by its socialism. Socialism has certainly helped strangle the country in permits. But perhaps De Soto is right that the real crippling thing is keeping most of the people out of the legal, official property system.Putting most of the people in the property system was something the west only finished about 100 years ago, or Japan did 50 years ago. It wasn't easy, but we live in a society that doesn't even remember we did it. -----Original Message----- From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Robert Harley Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:24 AM To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org Subject: Re: The Curse of India's SocialismRAH quoted: Indians are not poor because there are too many of them; they are poor because there are too many regulations and too much government intervention -- even today, a decade after reforms were begun.

Since all parties must stand for socialism, no party espouses classical liberalismI'm not convinced that that classical liberalism is a good solution for countries in real difficulty. See Joseph Stiglitz (Nobel for Economics) on the FMI's failed remedies. Of course googling on ""Stiglitz FMI"" only brings up links in Spanish and French.

2480,"interesting article interesting article , especially since it came from britain . . . it does mention enron too . the next global city ? the blob that ate east texas jun 21 st 2001 houston from the economist print edition ( june 23 , 2001 ) for most outsiders , texas is a foreign country . its biggest city , though , might surprise the rest of the world when a texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is , reach for the salt . bob lanier , the former mayor of houston , isn ' t actually wearing a stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls 25 miles away in every direction . but metaphorically he is . houston , he claims , could become one of the great cities of the world . the remarkable thing is that he might be right . from the time the city was founded in 1836 until the 1970 s , houston doubled in size almost every decade . then , despite one of the deepest slumps any city had experienced since the 1930 s , the metropolitan area managed to add lm people in the 1990 s to grow to 4 . 7 m , making houston the fourth - largest city in america . it is already bigger than berlin and , with a gdp of around $ 215 billion a year , has a larger economy than hong kong . because it is the nearest metropolis to the cities of northern mexico , it may attract another 2 m people over the next two decades , which would give it almost the same size of population as london has now . but a global city ? these are few and far between . houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centre like london , new york or tokyo . but its business leaders think it could become a cosmopolitan , entrepreneurial hub , a hong kong , a san francisco or even a new los angeles . it shares la ' s smog , its sprawl , its latino culture , even its ugly hubris ; and by some measures it surpasses la ' s ability to reinvent its economy . can it use its adaptability to turn itself into a properly international place ? oil be there for you its hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industry . energy accounts for half of houston ' s economy . during the 1970 s , while the rest of america stagflated , houston boomed as high oil prices sucked billions into the country ' s oil capital . in that decade alone , the city built almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercial property available in san francisco . money was being lent and business plans formed on the assumption that oil would go to $ 50 a barrel . at the height of the boom , about 80 % of the city ' s economy was oil - related . the bust was traumatic . by the mid - 1980 s , all that new office space stood empty . every big local bank was taken over . only one of the property developers then in business is left . unsurprisingly , a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oil business . the greater houston partnership , the main business lobby , has spent the past 20 years frantically encouraging the city to diversify . yet the fact is that the energy business and houston itself have emerged stronger from the terrible bust . as company after company was forced to cut back , they collapsed their operations back into houston and seem unlikely to be dispersed again . in 1999 , when oil slumped to $ 10 a barrel and the number of oil rigs in america fell to its lowest point in living memory , houston still managed to add energy jobs . now another boom is in prospect , with oil prices high again . matt simmonds , the head of a local energy consultancy , argues that america ' s past reluctance to build new power plants will force it to increase energy capacity by around 30 % in the next ten or 15 years . the rig count is already 50 % above last year , and natural gas exploration is soaring . if oil prices stay high ( a big if ) and if other countries share america ' s energy worries , houston will grow in importance . it is hampered by a wild - catting reputation . in fact , the energy business is changing in three significant ways , and houston is the centre of all of them . first , technology . not long ago , oil drills went down to 1 , 500 feet ( 457 metres ) . now they go to 15 , 000 feet . companies use four - dimensional computer imaging to plan new fields ( time is the fourth ) . this is making oil an information - intensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skills available in houston . second , the cost of new oilfield exploration and development has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot always finance them alone . this makes deal - making vital , which is good for the city where deals are made . if you are not attending , say , lunch at houston ' s petroleum club , you are out of the loop . third and most important , oil is now only part of a bigger energy business , which includes electricity . once divided into self - contained regional markets run by local utilities , the electricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a national grid dominated by power producers and traders . big users now decide whether to buy power at long - or short - term rates , rather as they arrange their financing . a new business of energy arbitraging is emerging , and itscentre is houston . three of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their main tenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago . one of them , enron , is building a 50 , 000 - square - foot trading floor ? ? single - company answer to the chicago board of trade . enron has probably been houston ' s most successful energy company of the past ten years . it has never explored for , pumped up , or refined a single drop ofoil . out of the black stuff however well - placed houston is to take advantage of the energy business , it will never be a great city as a one - trick pony . its boosters point to other strengths : * trade . houston is america ' ssecond largest port , which is remarkable considering it is 50 miles from the sea . * computers . the city is home to compaq , america ' s third - largest pc maker . if you include dell , based in austin , two of america ? ? four big computer firms are in south - east texas , not silicon valley . * space . the national aeronautics and space administration centre is in houston , thanks to lyndonjohnson , a native son . * medicine . houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in the world . in a moment of extraordinary optimism , the city set aside 700 acres in the middle of town for medicine . the hospitals , clinics and research centres of the texas medical centre employ 55 , 000 people and deal with 70 , 000 patients a day . st luke ' s has performed more heart surgery than any other hospital in the world . md anderson and the texas children ' s hospital are among the top two in their respective specialities , cancerand paediatrics . this list has holes in it . houston has no real financial services ( the mainstay of the biggest global cities ) or pharmaceuticals ( despite the medical centre ) . and some of its new industries are less robust than the boosters claim . its port ' s success depends on the vagaries of mexico ' s economy . space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until the far - off day when the commercialisation of space arrives . the texas medical centre is set up on a not - for - profit basis , so it has not been able to commercialise its activities ( hence the lack of drug firms ) , though a new biotechnology park may help . in fact , houston ' s main hope for diversifying lies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible : its stunning ability to create new firms . for the past three years , houston has created more new companies than any city in america . it is almost certainly the best place either to start a business or find a first - time job . the reasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success . the beauty of entrepreneurialism the first is unmeasurable , a no - holds - barred optimism of the old school . one survey shows that about two - thirds of americans agree with the assertion that if you work hard in this city , eventually you will succeed . but houston ' s figure even at the bottom of the city ' s recession was 75 % , and now it is 88 % , the highest - ever , and ( says the survey ' s author , stephen klineberg of rice university ) the highest of any bigamerican city . it may not be true that anything is possible in houston , but people act as if it were . bill gilmer , the chief economist of the houston branch of the federal reserve system , argues that this explains why houston recovered so fast from the oil bust : unemployed engineers went out and set up their own firms , just as aerospace engineers did in los angeles when the end of the cold war put them out of business . the second advantage is technical . uniquely for an american metropolis , houston has no citywide zoning ordinances . when planning decisions are made , they are made by developers on their own land . for the would - be entrepreneur , it is thus easier and cheaper to find a place to set up shop in houston than in any other city in america . lack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that new developments be large to capture economies of scale . they expand in leapfrog fashion , ignoring small 20 - acre plots near the city centre in favour of vast planned towns further out . this drives land prices sharply down , especially the further you go from the centre . on top of that , an aversion to red tape makes it easy to get building permits . barton smith , a land economist at the university of houston , reckons lack of red tape is at least as important to keep costs low as lack of zoning laws . lack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms of usage ( residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere ) and racially . because there are no zoning laws to force , say , a bankrupt restaurant to re - open as a restaurant , areas change shape quickly . at the same time , houston is less segregated racially than any other city , bymost measures . one should not be over - impressed by this . whites in houston may be more likely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone of a different race in the previous week , but that hasn ' t stopped them heading for the suburbs . much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks , latinos and asians ( the city has america ' s second - largest vietnamese settlement after southern california ) . but because zoning laws do not enable local groups to keep poor people out ( for example , by requiring that all housing plots be huge ) , houston remains racially desegregated by american standards . this helps draw in immigrant workers , creating a pool of labour . that leads to the third of houston ' s main characteristics which should prove an advantage in the 21 st century : racial tolerance . houston looked like a southern town until the 1970 s : white , with a large black minority . a generation later , its population is roughly one - third white , one - third black and ( slightly over ) one - third brown . other cities have similar profiles but none went from a bi - racial to amulti - racial city quite so abruptly . even more strikingly , it did so peacefully . houston has not had a race riot since 1914 . for the largest southern city to have gone through the civil - rights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable comment on its politics . minorities have long been fully or over - represented in the city council , county commissions and the texas state legislature . bob stein of rice university argues that , unlike other growing cities , houston is reinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civic - minded business leaders , the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the city . ken lay , enron ' s chairman , is an example . he has been the driving force behind the building of two sports stadiums , and has a pet project to boost child literacy . rumour has it that he may run for mayor . the effect of this sort of civic - minded activism showed up in the late 1990 s . at a time when america was busily abolishing affirmative - action programmes , houston went the other way : it had a new one approved in a city - wide referendum . for better or worse , this showed how racially tolerant it is . for how much longer ? in many ways , houston is thriving because it has kept alive an old - fashioned , industrial mode of growth , built on cheap land , low taxes , immigrant labour and unfettered pro - business policies . this model may not be enough in the next decades . houston is ugly . it was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled down many of its old buildings . it may have to pull down even more after recent floods caused $ 2 billion - worth of damage . it is also , as al gore rudely pointed out during the presidential campaign , polluted . since cities now have to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits , this is a big problem , and not one that can be overcome by cheap housing . business leaders are frantically trying to catch up . in an unusual example of bipartisanship , a fervently conservative property developer has joined forces with a former member of the clinton administration to back a $ 500 m bond issue to plant lm trees . the greater houston partnership has executed an about - turn on pollution . having argued last year that new pollution controls damage growth , it is now on a crash course to cut ozone - creating emissions as fast as it can . if this sudden change of mind is real , it poses a tough question about zoning . houston has 2 , 300 people an acre , compared with 6 , 000 in los angeles and 20 , 000 in new york ( at the other end of the scale ) . this extraordinary extensiveness is expensive . at one point in the early 1990 s , houston alone was spending more on roads than any state except california ( and , of course , texas ) . there are doubts about how much further sprawl can go . three - quarters of the best - paid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road . some new suburbs are 50 miles away . can the city continue to burst outwards while attracting the skilled people whose jobs are downtown ? and surely that means introducing zoning ? lastly , houston faces a severe problem in the one area where its national reputation is high : education . to run his number - one priority , mr bush picked as secretary of education rod paige , a former head of the houston independent school district . the president claimed , correctly , that mr paige had overseen substantial improvements in the city ' s education , especially among minorities . what he did not say is that these improvements have been nothing like enough . despite successes in individual schools , half of all latinos fail to graduate from high school , compared with 10 % of whites and 20 % of blacks . whites are abandoning houston ' s public schools . they represent only 12 % of pupils ; 54 % are latino . more than a quarter of today ' s schoolchildren are likely to dropout . in a world where a good job depends on having a college degree , this is alarming . rice university ' s mr klineberg argues that new immigrants from mexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationally than did the wave of immigrants in the early 1900 s . the first wave took several generations to catch up . today ' s immigrants will have to close a bigger gap more quickly . if they do not , they may end up in an underclass that could scratch at houston ' sracial harmony . this is houston can houston make it ? the city has experienced the three big transformations that affect america in their purest form : the change from a raw - material economy to services ; the change from a bi - racial to a multi - racial place ; and the moderation of a no - holds - barred pro - business culture to take account of environmental and social costs . elsewhere , these changes have occurred over 50 years . houston has lived through them in 20 . and the next 20 years will probably be just as dramatic and successful . hold onto those stetsons . copyright ? ? 1995 -
